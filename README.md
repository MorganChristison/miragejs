# mirage-js

</br>
**Mirage-JS**  is a lightweight developer library that gives developers access to a customizable and interactive video chat component.
With a short setup process, a developer can write custom animations and filters or use our robust presets, and can integrate that with a video chat component built on peer to peer webRTC technology. This enables clients access to real time multimedia interactions drawn on 2d canvas overlays.


## Setup

1. Install it from npm
```bash
npm install --save mirage-js
```
2. In client-side Javascript file require mirage-js.
```bash
const mirage = require('mirage-js');
```
3. On the server, navigate to our socket-logic file on node_modules (if server is in root directory, require from './node_modules/server/mirageSocket.js');
```bash
const mirageSocket = require('./node_modules/server/socketLogic.js');
```
